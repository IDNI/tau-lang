# To run it you need to compile the project using release.sh (customized with
# your settings if needed) and then execute the run.sh whithin the demo directory
# as follows:
#
# ./run.sh demo_1.2-commands_and_history.tau
#
# This demo should work under any *nix flavour due to the paths used for files.
# To run it under windows you will need to change the paths to the files.

# The above notations used to access the history can also be used in the commands.
# For example, the following commands will compute the DNF of a Boolean function
# passed as an argument or as a memory position.

(X | Y) & Z 		# store a Boolean function
(X | Y') & Z		# store another Boolean function
dnf %-1 			# convert to DNF the first formula in history
dnf %1				# also convert to DNF the first formula in history
(X | Y) & Z'		# store another Boolean function
dnf %				# convert to DNF the last formula in history
dnf (X | Y | W) & Z # simply compute the DNF of the given Boolean function

# The same happens when using formulas. The following command will convert
# formulas to CNF.

(X Y ) | Z			# store a formula
cnf %				# convert to CNF the last formula in history
cnf %-1				# convert to CNF the same formula
cnf %1				# convert to CNF the first formula in history
cnf (X Y) | Z		# convert to CNF the given formula

quit # quit the Tau REPL
