§ 3 Termination. The Agreement is effective on the date you receive the Product and remains effective until terminated. Your rights under this Agreement terminate immediately without notice from IDNI AG if you materially breach any terms of this agreement or take any action against IDNI AG’s rights to the Product.  IDNI AG may terminate this Agreement immediately should any part of the Product become the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of and destroy all copies of the Product under your control and confirm compliance in writing to IDNI AG. Neither termination of this Agreement nor any deletion or removal of the Product shall limit any obligations you may have to IDNI AG, or any rights and/or remedies that IDNI AG may have with respect to any past or future infringing use of the Product (including, but not limited to, any use of the Product outside the scope of the license provided in this Agreement).  Sections 2-8 survive termination of this Agreement.


§ 4 Disclaimer of Warranty.  IDNI AG provides the Product “as is,” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.  IDNI AG specifically disclaims any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.  You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Product.  If the Product is defective in any way, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.


§ 5 Limitation of Liability. In no event will IDNI AG or any personnel associated with IDNI AG be liable for any lost revenue, profit, data, or data use, or for special, indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, regardless of the cause of loss or theory of liability, arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use the Product.  In no event will IDNI AG or any personnel associated with IDNI AG be liable for third party claims based on your use of the Product.  You agree to indemnify IDNI AG and personnel associated with IDNI AG for any claims brought by third parties arising from use of the Product.

§ 6 Separately Licensed Third Party Technology.  The Product may contain or require the use of third party technology that is provided with the Product.  IDNI AG may provide certain notices to you in the Product’s documentation, readmes or notice files in connection with such third party technology.  Third party technology will be licensed to you either under the terms of this Agreement or, if specified in the documentation, readmes, or notice files, under Separate Terms.  Your rights to use Separately Licensed Third Party Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in any way by this Agreement.  However, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Third Party Technology shall be deemed part of the Product and is licensed to you under the terms of this Agreement. “Separate Terms” refers to separate license terms that are specified in the Product’s documentation, readmes, or notice files, and that apply to Separately Licensed Third Party Technology. “Separately Licensed Third Party Technology” refers to third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms and not under the terms of this Agreement.
