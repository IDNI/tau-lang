# **Introduction**

The Tau language is an expressive, decidable and executable formal software specification
language. It allows for specifying software using requirements and constraints in a purely
logical and declarative approach.
Tau specifications can be checked for satisfiability, effectively deciding if there exists a program
matching the specification. Furthermore, the Tau framework
is able to synthesize a program adhering to a satisfiable specification.

Imagine programming by writing the tests only, while getting a working program automatically which
is guaranteed to pass all the tests, thus meeting all the specified requirements.

A unique feature of the Tau language is the ability to specify programs capable of mechanized
deductive reasoning over Tau specifications themselves. This allows for a controlled adaption of new
requirements because the requirements for the requirements can be taken into account,
which is useful for collaborative specification, maintenance,
updates, safety and user control.

All features discussed below in this readme are available but can have performance issues.


# **Installing the Tau Language Framework**

## **Linux**

Currently, we automatically build the following binaries packages (AMD64 architecture):

* deb (Debian/Ubuntu): [tau-0.7-Linux.deb](https://github.com/IDNI/tau-lang/releases/download/v0.7-alpha/tau-0.7-Linux.deb)
* rpm (Fedora): [tau-0.7-Linux.rpm](https://github.com/IDNI/tau-lang/releases/download/v0.7-alpha/tau-0.7-Linux.rpm)

The executable is installed in `/usr/bin/tau`.

## **Windows**

For windows, we provide a convenient installer that includes the tau executable
and also a zip file:

* Installer: [tau-0.7-win64.exe](https://github.com/IDNI/tau-lang/releases/download/v0.7-alpha/tau-0.7-win64.exe)
* Zip file: [tau-0.7-win64.zip](https://github.com/IDNI/tau-lang/releases/download/v0.7-alpha/tau-0.7-win64.zip)

## **MacOS (not available yet)**

A macOS installer will be available in the future.

## **Compiling the source code**

To compile the source code you need a recent C++ compiler supporting C++23, e.g.
GCC 13.1.0. You also need at least cmake version 3.22.1 installed in your system.
The only code dependencies are the Boost C++ Libraries (libboost) and the CVC5 SMT Solver (`libcvc5-dev` in `debian`
derived distros).
CVC5 is used only in order to support the theory of bitvectors within the language.
The core language and its algorithms are independent of CVC5.

After cloning:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IDNI/tau-lang.git
```

you can run either the `release.sh` or `debug.sh` or `relwithdebinfo.sh` scripts
to build the binaries.

To build with doxygen documentation:

```bash
# Compiles the source code in release mode and also the documentation
./release.sh -DBUILD_DOC=ON
# Compiles the source code in debug mode and also the documentation
./debug.sh -DBUILD_DOC=ON
# Compiles the source code in release mode with debug information and also the documentation
./relwithdebinfo.sh -DBUILD_DOC=ON
```

Once you have compiled the source code you can run the `tau` executable to
execute Tau specifications. The `tau` executable is located in either `build-Release`
or `build-Debug` or `build-RelWithDebInfo`.


# **Quick start**

To start using the Tau Language, download the latest release from the
[GitHub page](https://github.com/IDNI/tau-lang/releases/tag/v0.7-alpha). Once
you have downloaded and installed the executable (see the Section
[Installing the Tau Framework](#installing-the-tau-language-framework)), you can run
it from the command line by typing `tau`.

The programming model underlying the Tau Language is fully declarative. You
specify, possibly only very implicitly, how the current and previous inputs and
outputs are related, at each point of time. As a result, you do not write a program
in the Tau Language, but a specification which effectively represents all programs that
meet this specification. Once you run a specification, you actually run one
automatically-chosen representative program from that set.

In the scope of the Tau Language, a specification is [satisfiable](#satisfiability-and-execution),
loosely speaking, if for all inputs, at each point in time, there exist outputs,
that do not depend on future inputs while matching the specification.
Implied from this definition is that all specifications run
indefinitely no matter what the inputs are.

For example, the following specification:

```
o1[t] = 0
```

states that the output `o1` at all time points `t` has to be `0`. Similarly, the
following specification:

```
o1[t] = i1[t]
```

states that the output `o1` has to be the same as the input
`i1` at all time points `t`.
In the above examples, `o1` and `i1` are [streams](#streams). They are used to define
the inputs and outputs of the specification.

An example of how to define input and output streams is the following:

```
tau i1 = console
tau o1 = console
```

In the above case we specify that `i1` and `o1` are of type `tau`, namely that
they are Tau specifications, and they take values from the console (e.g. stdin/stdout).
The type defines from which Boolean algebra the values come from. The `tau` type is a unique
property of the Tau langauge because it enables Tau specifications to reason over
Tau specifications themselves abstracted as Boolean algebra elements.

You can also define files as input or output streams:

```
tau i1 = ifile("input.in")
tau o1 = ofile("output.out")
```

The above two examples, `o1[t] = 0` and `o1[t] = i1[t]`, define one program each
(there's a caveat in this statement, but we shall ignore it here). This is not
always the case. An example
of a Tau specification that specifies infinitely many programs is

```
o1[t] & i1[t] = 0
```
because many different assignments to `o1[t]` can be chosen as valid output. Each choice
represents one program.
Here `&` denotes conjunction in the Boolean algebra from which the inputs and outputs
are taken from. This specification says that the conjunction has to be empty.

Clearly, you can consider more complicated specifications, e.g.:

```
o1[t] & o1[t-1] & i1[t] = 0 || o1[t] = i1[t]
```

which states that at each point in time, either the conjunction of the current
output with the previous output and with the current input, has to be 0, or, the
output has to equal the input. Note the difference between [Boolean (algebraic
operations)](#boolean-functions) and [Logical operators](#tau-specifications) .
The former are `&, |, '`, and the latter are `&&, ||, !`.

In order to simplify the process of writing and running Tau specifications, we allow
[function and predicate definitions](#functions-and-predicates),
possibly by means of recurrence relations.
The following is a simple predicate defined by a recurrence relation,
which takes as argument a Tau term:

```
f[0](y) := T
f[n](y) := f[n - 1](y)
```

which you can use in your specification as follows:

```
o1[t] = 0 && f(i1[t])
```

Also, you can use the following recurrence relation definition

```
g[0](y) := 0
g[n](y) := g[n - 1](y)'
```

which defines a function (rather than a predicate) and alternates between 0 and 1
depending on the parity of n.

In the [demos](https://github.com/IDNI/tau-lang/tree/main/demos) folder you
can find lots of examples regarding how to use the Tau Language, its semantics
and workings.

# **The Tau Language**

The core idea of the Tau Language is to specify how current and previous inputs and outputs of a program
are related over time, using the first-order theory of finite and infinite atomless Boolean algebras
extended with a time dimension, represented by the natural numbers starting at 0. It was carefully crafted around being purely logical,
allowing efficient and decidable satisfiability checking, while being executable,
yielding a framework to enable program synthesis.

For example, you can write `o1[t] & o1[t-1] & i1[t] = 0`
which means that the current output `o1[t]`, the previous output `o1[t-1]`, and the current input `i1[t]`,
have to have an empty intersection. The set-theoretic perspective of Boolean algebra
is given by Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras. More concretely,
when a Tau specification is treated as a Boolean algebra element,
it can be seen as a set of all programs that admit that specification, and the Boolean
operations are the set-theoretic union/intersection and complementation.

A key feature is the ability of checking satisfiability of Tau specifications within Tau specifications
using the theory of Boolean equations and an abstraction of specifications to Boolean algebra elements.
This enables, in particular, a novel approach to software updates. A specification which is currently
executed, can take as an input an arbitrary new Tau specification, seen as an update, check if the proposed new specification is
satisfiable and incorporate the update into the existing specification using an operation we call pointwise revision.
Section [Pointwise revision](#pointwise-revision) provides a more detailed introduction to this feature and how to use it.

The following is a general introduction to using the Tau language.

## **Tau specifications**

At the top level, a Tau specification (we also say `spec`) is a collection of
"always" and "sometimes" statements applied to *local specifications*
(expressed by `local_spec`, see below),
combined by the logical
connectives *and*, *or* and *not*, denoted by `&&`, `||` and `!` respectively.
For example a well-formed Tau specification is
```
(always local_spec1) && (sometimes local_spec2)
```
where *local_spec1* and
*local_spec2* are formulas as described below.
We say local specification because such a formula can only talk about a fixed
(though arbitrary) point in time.

In order for a specification to communicate with the outside world, so-called *streams*
are use. Those streams come in two flavors: input and output streams. Input
streams are used in a `local_spec` to receive input from a user, while output streams
are used for presenting output to a user. Each stream in the specification
is associated with a relative or constant point in time.
For example the output stream variable `o1[t-2]` means
"the value in output stream number 1 two time-steps ago". So `o1[t]` would mean
"the value in output stream number 1 at the current time-step". Likewise, for
input stream variables like `i1[t]`. It means "the input in the input stream
1 at the current time-step". Input streams can also have an offset in order to
speak about past inputs. For example `i2[t-3]` means "the input in the input
stream 2 three time-steps ago". For further detail about streams, please refer
to section [Streams](#streams).

In all above cases, `t` is a free variable and refers to the current time at
each point in time. The key point now is that an `always` statement will
quantify all scoped `t` universally, while a `sometimes` statement will quantify
them existentially. For example the specification `always o1[t] = 0` says that
at all time-steps the output stream number 1 will write `0`. Similarly, the
specification `sometimes o1[t] = 0` says that there exists a time-step at which
the output stream 1 will write `0`. When executing a Tau specification, the first
time-step is always 0.

Formally, the grammar for Tau specifications is
```
spec => local_spec | always local_spec | sometimes local_spec
      | (spec && spec) | (spec || spec) | !spec
```
where `local_spec` is a formula defined by the rules:

```
local_spec => (local_spec "&&" local_spec)
            | ("!" local_spec)
            | (local_spec "^" local_spec)
            | (local_spec "||" local_spec)
            | (local_spec "->" local_spec)
            | (local_spec "<->" local_spec)
            | (local_spec "?" local_spec ":" local_spec)
            | (term "=" term) | (term "!=" term)
            | (term "<" term) | (term "!<" term) | (term "<=" term) | (term "!<=" term)
            | (term ">" term) | (term "!>" term) | (term ">=" term)| (term "!>=" term) |
            | (bv_term "=_" bv_term) | (bv_term "!=_" bv_term)
            | (bv_term "<_" bv_term) | (bv_term "!<_" bv_term) | (bv_term "<=_" bv_term) | (bv_term "!<=_" bv_term)
            | (bv_term ">_" bv_term) | (bv_term "!>_" bv_term) | (bv_term ">=_" bv_term)| (bv_term "!>=_" bv_term) |
            | "all" variable local_spec
            | "ex" variable local_spec
            | predicate
            | T | F
```
The naming conventions for `variable` are discussed in [Variables](#variables).
Furthermore, `term` is discussed in the section [Boolean functions](#boolean-functions)
and `bv_term`, bitvector term, is discussed in the section [Bitvectors](#bitvectors).
The `predicate` non-terminal in the above grammar describes how
to add predicate definitions directly into a formula. See the subsection
[Functions and predicates](#functions-and-predicates) for the
grammar definition of `predicate`.
In the REPL ([The Tau REPL](#the-tau-repl)) they
can be provided as explained in subsection
[Functions, predicates and input/output stream variables](#functions-predicates-and-inputoutput-stream-variables).

The symbols used have the following meaning, where a formula refers to either `local_spec` or `spec`:

| Symbol            | Meaning                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `!`               | negation of formula                                    |
| `&&`              | conjunction of formulas                                |
| `^`               | xor of formulas                                        |
| `\|\|`            | disjunction of formulas                                |
| `<->`             | equivalence of formulas                                |
| `<-`              | left-implication of formulas                           |
| `->`              | right-implication of formulas                          |
| `ex`              | existential quantification of `variable`               |
| `all`             | universal quantification of `variable`                 |
| `... ? ... : ...` | if ... then ... else ...                               |
| `=`               | standard equality relation in Boolean algebra          |

| `!>=`             | standard not-greater-equal relation in Boolean algebra |
| `=_`              | standard equality relation in bitvectors               |
| `!=_`             | standard inequality relation in bitvectors             |

| `<=_`             | standard less-equal relation in bitvectors             |
| `!<=_`            | standard not-less-equal relation in bitvectors         |
| `>_`              | standard greater relation in bitvectors                |
| `!>_`             | standard not-greater relation in bitvectors            |

| `!>=_`            | standard not-greater-equal relation in bitvectors      |

The precedence of the logical operators/quantifiers is as follows (from higher
precedence to lower):
`!` > `&&` > `^` > `||` > `<->` > `<-` > `->` > `ex ... ...` > `all ... ...` >
`... ? ... : ...` > `always ...`> `sometimes ...`.

A Tau specification without a mentioning of "always" or "sometimes" is implicitly
assumed to be an "always" statement.

Note that instead of writing `always` and `sometimes` you can also use box `[]`
and diamond `<>`, respectively.

Using this notation, a slightly bigger example of a Tau spec would be

```
    ([] o1[t] i1[t] = 0 && (i1[t] != 1 -> o1[t] != 0)) && (<> o1[t] = i1[t]')
```

which reads: at each point of time, the output should be disjoint from the input.
If the input is not 1, then the output is not zero. And, at least once during
execution, the output equals the complement of the input.


## **Satisfiability and execution**

### Satisfiability

The notion of satisfiability in the Tau language is non-standard and conceptually defined in such a way
that a satisfiable Tau specification can be executed indefinitely regardless of the
inputs given to the specification. In particular, a specification is unsatisfiable
if a particular sequence of inputs would result in a contradictory situation.

This notion of satisfiability is achieved by a certain quantification pattern of
streams, which we call *time-compatability*. More precisely, all input streams are quantified
universally and all output streams are quantified existentially in such a way that
1. the ordering of
   quantifiers is increasing with respect to the time step to which the quantified variable refers and
2. the outputs always depend on the inputs in a given step.

More informally, we can think of the phrase that _for all input,
there exists output at each point in time such that the Tau specification
can be satisfied_ (in the standard sense).

The following example shows the explained quantification pattern for the Tau specification `o1[t] = i1[t] && ( i1[t-2] = 1 -> o2[t-1] = 1 )`:
```
all i1[t-2] ex o2[t-1] all i1[t] ex o1[t] o1[t] = i1[t] && ( i1[t-2] = 1 -> o2[t-1] = 1 )
```

This explanation of satisfiability neglects the fact that a contradiction can, in fact, occur only
after a specification is executed for a certain number of steps. The entire procedure is, hence, (much) more involved.
Further resources concerning the details can be found in the [theory section](#the-theory-behind-the-tau-language).

### Execution

We have talked about the execution of a Tau specification. Here we want to
explain in more detail what that means. In general, the execution of Tau specification
is about receiving values for the input streams from a source and to produce values
for the output streams in accordance with the specification.
In this fashion, a Tau specification is started at time step 0.
In each consecutive step the time step is incremented by 1. As a result, we get a
continues timeline starting at 0 and ending at however far the specification has
been executed.

Take for a minimal example the specification `always o1[t] = i1[t]`,
saying that at each time step `t`, the input `i1` is equal to the output `o1`.
Executing this specification means to start at `t := 0`. Hence, in the first step
during execution we have `o1[0] = i1[0]`. The value for `i1[0]` is then requested,
let's call it `v`.
After the value is received, `i1[0]` is replaced with `v`, yielding `o1[0] = v`.
At this point the specification has as only stream the output `o1[0]` remaining and,
hence, can be passed to an internal solver
to get a value for `o1[0]`, matching the specification. In this case this is easy, since
it is immediate that `o1[0]` has to be `v` as well.
Outputting the result for `o1[0]` then concludes the first step of execution. We then move
to the next step being `t := 1`, which yields `o1[1] = i1[1]` for the specification. The steps
above are now repeated such that at the end of the step, the value for `o1[1]` is outputted.
In the same fashion execution can now be continued as long as desired.

For more complicated specifications the main steps stay the same:
1. Execution is started at `t := 0`
2. The inputs are requested (if present)
3. The outputs are produced according to the specification after the received inputs
have been plugged in
4. The time step `t` is incremented by 1 and execution continues from point 2. above

Note that before a Tau specification is executed, it is checked for satisfiability in the sense
that it can be executed indefinitely as described above. During this process the specification
is also converted to what we call _unbounded continuation_ which essentially adds all implicit
assumptions from a specification ensuring that the solutions for output stream values
do not make the execution contradictory in a future step.

It is not always the case that the values which can be assigned to outputs are unique.
For this reason, a single specification can give rise to a multitude of different programs
differing in the choices made for assignments. As a result, during execution only
one of possibly many program is executed. The execution process in Tau, however,
is fully deterministic, so that the same program is always chosen for the same specification.


## **Boolean functions**

One of the key ingredients of the Tau Language are Boolean functions build from
Boolean combinations of variables, streams and constants over some fixed atomless (or
finite -to be developed-) Boolean algebra. In particular, each Boolean
function has a unique type being this chosen Boolean algebra.
They are given by the following grammar:

```
term => (term "&" term) | term "'"
      | (term "+" term) | (term "|" term)
      | function | constant | uninterpreted_constant
      | variable | stream_variable | "0" | "1"

```

where

* `term` stands for a well-formed subformula representing a Boolean function and the operators `&`, `'`,
`+` (or equivalently `^`) and `|` respectively stand for conjunction, negation, exclusive-or
and disjunction,
* `function` is the non-terminal symbol used to incorporate function definitions (see the subsection
[Functions and Predicates](#functions-and-predicates)),
* `constant` stands for an element from an available Boolean algebra. The type of the constant
determines the type of the Boolean function (see subsection [Constants](#constants) for details).
* `uninterpreted_constant` stands for an uninterpreted constant from the fixed Boolean
algebra, which can be thought of as a variable being existentially quantified from the outside of
the formula. Its syntax is as follows:

```
uninterpreted_constant => "<" [name] ":" name ">"
```

* `variable` is a variable over the fixed Boolean algebra (see subsection
[Variables](#variables) for details),
* `stream_variable` represents an input or output
stream. The type of a stream also determines the type of the Boolean function (see also subsection [Variables](#variables)) and
* `0` and `1` stand for the bottom and top element in the fixed Boolean
algebra.

The order of the operations is the following (from higher precedence
to lower): `'` > `&` > `+` (equivalently > `^`) > `|`.

If no type information is present within a Boolean function, it is assumed to be of the
general type `countable atomless Boolean algebra`. Since all such Boolean algebras are
isomorphic, no particular model is chosen.

For example, the following is a valid Boolean function of general type:

```
(x & y | (z ^ 0))
```

where `x`, `y` and `z` are variables.

## **Bitvectors**

Another key ingredient of the Tau Language is bitvectors build from
usual bityvector operations and variables, streams and bitvector constants
They are given by the following grammar:

bv_constant => "#b" [0-1]+ | "#x" [0-9a-fA-F]+ | [0-9]+
```

where

```

where `bv_term` stands for a well-formed subformula representing a bitvector term,
`bv_constant` is a bitvector constant, `variable` and `stream_variable` are as above and 
the operators meaning is given in the following table:

| Symbol            | Meaning                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `*`               | modular multiplication of bitvectors                   |
| `/`               | modular division of bitvectors                         |
| `%`               | modular remainder of bitvectors                        |
| `+`               | modular addition of bitvectors                         |
| `-`               | modular subtraction of bitvectors                      |
| `~`               | bitwise negation of bitvector                          |
| `&`               | bitwise and of bitvectors                              |
| `!&`              | bitwise nand of bitvectors                             |
| `|`               | bitwise or of bitvectors                               |
| `!|`              | bitwise nor of bitvectors                              |
| `(+ )`            | bitwise xor of bitvectors                              |
| `!(+)`            | bitwise xnor of bitvectors                             |
| `<<`              | left shift of bitvector by a number of bits            |
| `>>`              | right shift of bitvector by a number of bits           |


The order of the operations is the following (from higher precedence
to lower): `*', `/`, `%` > `+`, `-` > `~` > `&`, `!&` > `|`, `!|` > `(+ )`, `!(+)` > `<<`, `>>`. 

The type of the variables is automatically inferred from the context in which they are used. 
Currently there is no need to define them explicitly, but this might change in the future.

## **Functions and predicates**

Another key concept in the Tau Language are functions and predicates. They are given
by the following grammar where `function_def` defines the syntax for a function
and `predicate_def` defines the syntax for a predicate:

```
function_def      => function ":=" term
function          => name "[" index+  "]" "(" [ variable ("," variable)* ] ")"
predicate_def     => predicate ":=" spec
predícate         => name "[" index+  "]" "(" [ variable ("," variable)* ] ")"
```

where `name` is the name of the function or predicate (it has to be a sequence of
letters and numbers starting by a letter) and `index` is a positive integer or
a variable or a variable minus a positive integer, i.e.:

```
index => number | variable | variable "-" number
```

Simple examples of function definitions are
```
union(x, y, z) := x | y | z
intersection(x, y, z) := x & y & z
bf(a, b, x) := ax | bx'
```
while sample predicate definitions are
```
bottom(x) := x = 0
not_atom(x) := ex y y < x && y != 0
chain(x,y,z) := x < y && y < z  
```

Furthermore, it is supported to define a function or a predicate by means of a
recurrence relations. Let's see a small example for such a function definition:
```
rotate[0](x,y,z) := x&y | z
rotate[n](x,y,z) := rotate[n-1](y,z,x)
```
As can be seen `rotate[n](x,y,z)` is defined in terms of `rotate[n-1](y,z,x)`. Together
with the initial condition `rotate[0](x,y,z)`, `rotate[k](x,y,z)` can be calculated for any positive
number `k`, and essentially rotates the arguments counterclockwise until reaching `rotate[0](...)`.

A similar but more complex example for predicates is
```
f[0](w,x,y,z) := x & { always o1[t] = 0 } != 0
f[n](w,x,y,z) := f[n-1](x,y,z,w)

h[0](w,x,y,z) := f[0](w,x,y,z)
h[n](w,x,y,z) := h[n-1](w,x,y,z) && f[n](w,x,y,z)
```
As a result, calling `h[3](w,x,y,z)` checks that none of the arguments `w,x,y,z`
assumes `sometimes o1[t] != 0`.

As can be seen, recurrence relations can also refer to other recurrence relations.
The rule one must follow is that the `index` at the right-hand side of `:=` is not bigger
than any `index` on the left. In addition, there must be no circular dependency among the
recurrence relation definitions in use.

Furthermore, we support the calculation of a fixpoint of a defined recurrence relation during normalization.
The syntax is to call a defined recurrence relation as
```
name "(" [ variable ("," variable)* ] ")"
```
hence, omitting the `index`. For example, using the recurrence relation `h` from above,
we can call the fix point by typing into [REPL](#the-tau-repl) `normalize h(x,y,z,w)`.
Not all recurrence relations have a fixpoint. In this case, by default, `0` is returned for functions and
`F` for predicates.

It should be noted that recurrence relations in the Tau language are a conservative extension,
meaning that they do not add to the general expressiveness.

## **Constants**

Constants in the Tau Language are elements of some available Boolean algebra,
usually different from just `0` and `1`. Constants in a particular Boolean algebra come
with their own syntax.

In the Tau language, we currently support two Boolean algebras, which we also call the base Boolean algebras:
1. the Boolean algebra of Tau specifications (also referred to as Tau Boolean algebra)
2. the Boolean algebra of simple Boolean functions

Several others are in development, like the Boolean algebra of bitvectors of fixed bit width and
the Boolean algebra of Boolean (not just simple) functions in general.

The Boolean algebra of Tau specifications is an extensional Boolean
algebra that encodes Tau specifications over arbitrary available other Boolean algebras.
As a result, it is possible to have a Tau specification that itself has a Tau specification
as a constant, allowing controlled reasoning of Tau specifications over Tau specifications.

Given the available algebras, the general syntax for constants is the following:

```
constant => "{" (spec | term) "}" [":" base_boolean_algebra_type]
```

where `base_boolean_algebra_type` is given by:

```
base_boolean_algebra_type => "tau" | "sbf"
```

As mentioned, we can have a Tau specification seen as a Boolean algebra element (you can omit
the type, since `tau` is the default type). For example, the following is a valid
constant in the Tau Boolean algebra:

```
{ ex x ex y ex z (x & y | z) = 0 }:tau
```

or even a deeper nesting resulting in

```
{ { ex x ex y ex z (x & y | z) = 0 }:tau = 0 }:tau
```

where `x`, `y` and `z` are variables.

A constant in the simple Boolean function algebra is for example:

```
{ (x & y | z) }:sbf
```

where `x`, `y` and `z` are variables.

## **Streams**

Streams represent the input and the output of Tau specifications. They are the
communication with the outside world, so to speak.
We currently have two kinds of them: input streams and output streams.
The syntax is given by

`stream_variable => "o(number)[" index "]" | "i(number)[" index "]"`

where `index` is defined in subsection [Functions and predicates](#functions-and-predicates).
Hence, `o1[t]` is a valid output stream, whereas `i1[t]` is a valid input stream.
In the future we will allow arbitrary names for streams, but for now `number`
is used as an identifier, while `o` denotes an output and `i` an input stream.

Both kinds of streams are indexed by time starting at the time step 0. A stream
associates to each time step a Boolean algebra element matching the type of the stream.

Which Boolean algebra element is associated, is decided by the Tau specification
in which the stream is used. For example, the specification `always o1[t] = 0`
says that `o1` associates `0` to each time step. One can alternatively think about this
as the value `0` being written into the stream `o1` at each time step.

There are several ways how a stream can refer to a time point. The following list uses an output stream
but input streams can be used in these same ways:
1. `o1[t]` refers to the current time point while executing a specification
2. `o1[t-k]` refers to the time point k steps ago while executing a specification
3. `o1[k]` refers to the fixed time point k while executing a specification

There are currently two ways to assign a type to a stream: either explicitly in
the REPL (see also subsection
[Functions, predicates and input/output stream variables](#functions-predicates-and-inputoutput-stream-variables))
or implicitly by using typed constants. In the later case the type for a stream is inferred.
In a nutshell, the inference process works as follows:
1. Typing a constant in a Boolean function, types the whole Boolean function.
Any stream appearing in this Boolean function will be assigned this type.
2. Streams that have been typed in a single Boolean function, are automatically typed
in all Boolean functions.
3. Streams that appear in a Boolean function, in which a different stream has been typed,
are typed accordingly.
4. If a stream cannot be typed by (possibly repeated application of) any of the above rules, it is assigned the default type `tau`.

Note that this stream type inference only happens if you start executing a Tau specification.
In case a type mismatch is detected, the execution does not start and is terminated.
Furthermore, types are currently not propagated using variables. The process only considers constants and streams.
Variables will be taken into account soon.

When typing a stream explicitly in [REPL](#the-tau-repl), the syntax is
```
<type> <stream_variable> = <stream_type>
```
where `<type>` is either `tau` or `sbf` and `<stream_type>` is either `console` (meaning that the
stream reads/outputs values from/to the console) or `ifile("<filename>")` for input streams and `ofile("<filename>")`
for output streams. `<filename>` denotes the file from/into which to read/write.


## **Variables and uninterpreted constants**

Variables range over Boolean algebra elements. As mentioned in subsection
[Boolean functions](#boolean-functions), each
variable can only appear as part of a `term` and has, thus, a unique type.

The syntax for the non-terminal `variable` depends on whether the `charvar` option
is enabled or not. See [REPL options](#repl-options) for further details about the option. The option is enabled by default.

If `charvar` is enabled, a variable is a single letter followed by an arbitrary sequence
of numbers.

If `charvar` is disabled, a variable can be any sequence of letters, numbers and `_`,
must however be started by a letter.

In the Tau language a variable can appear free or quantified universally or existentially. Since
a Tau specification has to be a closed formula, in order to be executable, variables appearing
in this context must appear under the scope of a quantifier.
In the Tau REPL, however, you can also work with
open formulas (i.e. when variables are not quantified).

### Uninterpreted constants

Finally, we also have uninterpreted constants. They can be thought of as a variable being
implicitly existentially quantified from the outside of the Tau specification.
For this reason, from a semantic point of view, they behave
more like variables than constants.
The syntax is mentioned above in subsection [Boolean functions](#boolean-functions).
The appearance of an uninterpreted constant within a Tau specification keeps the specification
closed. Note that when executing a specification containing uninterpreted constants
they are currently assigned a default value in a suitable way and the specification
is then executed with those assignments.


## **Pointwise revision**

As mentioned in the beginning, pointwise revision refers to the feature to incorporate
updates into a currently running specification. To this end, the special output stream `u`
is introduced. A Tau specification written into this stream, will be interpreted as a potential
update. If the proposed update is not satisfiable as a stand-alone specification, no update is performed. Otherwise,
the pointwise revision procedure is called, updating the currently running specification with the specification
written into `u`.

### Minimal example

Let us work with a concrete, minimal example to make the idea more clear. Afterwords,
the algorithm for pointwise revision is explained in more detail.

Suppose we execute the specification `u[t] = i1[t]`. By default, both streams are of type `tau`.
This can be done in the REPL by just entering
```
run u[t] = i1[t]
```
`u[t]` is the special output stream, while `i1[t]` is an ordinary input stream.
Hence, the specification says that the input into `i1` is written into `u` in each step of execution.
We now input `o1[t] = 1` for `i1[0]`. This will yield the following output:
```
u[0] := o1[t] = 1
```
Since `o1[t] = 1` is a satisfiable specification, the update is accepted and in
the following step 1, the running Tau specification is
```
u[t] = i1[t] && o1[t] = 1
```
If we now input `o2[t] = 0 && o2[t] = 1` for `i1[1]` in the next step,
no update is performed, because `o2[t]` cannot be 0 and 1 at the same time. So this
is an example of a very simple unsatisfiable specification.

Finally, in the next step we input `o1[t] = 0` for `i1[2]` as a proposed update. This is a satisfiable specification but contradicts
the currently running specification (we required `o1[t] = 1`). The pointwise revision algorithm will replace the
previous specification with the update, yielding just `o1[t] = 0`,
in order to ensure that the new specification is satisfiable.

Running this example in REPL (see [The Tau REPL](#the-tau-repl) below) yields:
```
tau> run u[t] = i1[t]

Temporal normalization of always specification reached fixpoint after 0 steps, yielding the result:
i1[t]u[t]' = 0 && i1[t]'u[t] = 0

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please provide requested input, or press ENTER to terminate                                               |
If no input is requested, press ENTER to continue to the next execution step, or type q(uit) to terminate |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Execution step: 0
i1[0] := o1[t] = 1
u[0] := always o1[t]' = 0

Updated specification:
always o1[t]' = 0 && i1[t]u[t]' = 0 && i1[t]'u[t] = 0

Execution step: 1
i1[1] := o2[t] = 0 && o2[t] = 1
o1[1] := T
u[1] := F

Execution step: 2
i1[2] := o1[t] = 0
o1[2] := T
u[2] := always o1[t] = 0

Updated specification:
always o1[t] = 0

Execution step: 3
o1[3] := F
u[3] := F

Execution step: 4
o1[4] := F
u[4] := F
...
```
Note, in order to interpret the output, that `1` of type `tau` is represented as `T` and `O` as `F`.
Furthermore, Tau specifications are always displayed normalized during execution.
The REPL informs the user whenever an update was done successfully by printing the new, updated specification.

### Pointwise revision details

The following is a detailed explanation of the pointwise revision algorithm. Pointwise revision is performed
at the end of an execution step in which a Tau specification, let's call it `update`, is written
into the output stream `u`. First, it is checked if `update` is satisfiable. This means that
for any given input at any given step during execution, there has to exist output satisfying the specification,
where in this later case the standard definition of satisfiability for a logical formula is meant.
If `update` is not satisfiable, it normalizes to `F` and no update is applied.

In case `update` is satisfiable, the following steps are performed:

1) `update` can refer to previous memory positions by using negative numbers in a stream index,
for example `o1[-k]`. Let `t` be the current time point of execution. Then `o1[-k]` is replaced with
the value at `o1[t-k]`. If no such memory position is present, no update is performed. Furthermore,
`t-k` must not be below 0. After replacing all such streams with
the respective value from the memory, it is checked again if `update` is satisfiable given these memory references.
If it is unsatisfiable, no update is performed. Otherwise, we move to the next step:
2) Let us refer to the currently running specification as `spec`. `spec` is composed of a single `always` statement
and possibly several `sometimes` statements. We denote the `always` part by `aw_spec` and the collection of
`sometimes` parts by `st_spec`. In the same way `aw_update` denotes the `always` part of `update`.
The next candidate for the updated specification, let's call it `U`, is given by <br>
`U := update && ( (ex [outputs] aw_update && aw_spec) -> aw_spec)`, where `[outputs]` refers to the list of all output streams present
in `aw_spec` and `aw_update` combined. The meaning is that, whenever possible given the current input at a particular step,
`update` and `aw_spec` are executed together. The name _pointwise revision_ originates from this behavior.
Note that it is possible to refine the definition of the new specification
in more advanced ways. We will explore this aspect in the future. <br>
If `update` is satisfiable, then `U` is satisfiable,
unless the `sometimes` part of `update`
prevents it. If it is prevented, `update` becomes the final updated specification.
Otherwise, `U` becomes the updated specification and the next step is performed.
3) As a final step, it is checked if the previous `sometimes` statements `st_spec` are executable along the updated specification `U`.
If this is the case, they are added to the updated specification. Otherwise,
`U` is accepted as the final update.

Note that in the step after an update was successfully applied, the new specification starts
running as if it was started at time step 0 shifted to the correct time step to match the overall
history. This means, in particular, that streams with lookback `k` only become solvable once the
specification has continued for at least `k` steps. For example, updating a specification in
step `s` with `o1[t] = i1[t-1]` means that in the next step `o1[s+1]` is unspecified.
To see this, assume we start at step 0. Then `o1[t] = i1[t-1]` will leave `o1[0]` unspecified
since `i1[-1]` is not defined, since we do not allow defining negative time steps in general. The only
exception is during pointwise revision in order to allow access to previous stream values,
as explained in step 1 above.

## **Reserved symbols**

Tau Language has a set of reserved symbols that cannot be used as identifiers.
In particular, we require that `T` and `F` are reserved for truth values in Tau specifications
and `0` and `1` stand for the corresponding Boolean
algebra elements.

# **Command line interface**

The general form of tau executable command line is:

```bash
tau [ options ] [ <specification> ]
```

where `[ options ]` are the command line options and `[ <specification> ]` is the Tau
specification you want to run. If you omit the tau specification, the Tau REPL will be
started.

The general options are the following:

| Option             | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| -h, --help         | detailed information about options                    |
| -l, --license      | show the license                                      |
| -v, --version      | show the version of the executable                    |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| -V, --charvar      | charvar (enabled by default)                          |
| -S, --severity     | severity level (trace/debug/info/error)               |
| -I, --indenting    | indenting of the formulas                             |
| -H, --highlighting | syntax highlighting                                   |

whereas the REPL specific options are:

| Options            | Description                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| -e, --evaluate     | REPL command to be evaluated                |
| -s, --status       | display status                              |
| -c, --color        | use colors                                  |
| -d, --debug        | debug mode                                  |

# **The Tau REPL**

The Tau REPL is a command line application that allows you to interact with the Tau
Language. It is a simple and easy to use tool that enables you to write and
execute Tau specifications on the fly.

## **Basic REPL commands**

The Tau REPL provides a set of basic commands that allow you to obtain help,
version information, exit the REPL and clear the screen. The syntax of
the commands is the following:

* `help|h [<command>]`: shows a general help message or the help message of a
specific command.

* `version|v`: shows the version of the Tau REPL. The version of the Tau REPL
corresponds to the repo commit.

* `quit|q` or `exit`: exits the Tau REPL.

* `clear|c`: clears the screen.

## **REPL options**

You have several options at your disposal to configure the Tau REPL. In order
to set or get the value of an option you can use the following commands:

* `get [<option>]`: shows all configurable settings and their values or a single
one if its name is provided.

* `set <option> [=] <value>`: sets a configurable option to a desired value.

* `toggle <option>`: toggle an option between on/off.

The options you have at your disposal are the following:

* `c|color|colors`: Can be on/off. Controls usage of terminal colors in its
output. It's on by default.

* `s|status`: Can be on/off. Controls status visibility in the prompt. It's on
by default.

* `sev|severity`: Possible values are trace/debug/info/error. The value determines
how much information the REPL will provide. This is set to error by default.

* `h|hilight|highlight`: Can be on/off. Controls usage of highlighting in the
output of commands. It's off by default.

* `i|indent|indentation`: Can be on/off. Controls usage of indentation in the
output of commands. It's on by default.

* `charvar|v`: Can be on/off. Controls usage of character variables in the
REPL. It's on by default.

* `d|dbg|debug`: Can be on/off. Controls debug mode. It's off by default.

## **Functions, predicates and input/output stream variables**

As in other programming languages, you can define functions, predicates (both possibly using recurrence
relations) but also input and output stream variables. The syntax of the commands
is the following:

* `definitions|defs`: shows all the definitions of the current session. That
includes the definitions of functions, predicates and the input/output stream variables.

* `definitions|defs <number>`: shows the definition of the given function or predicate.

* `predicate_def`: defines a predicate, supporting the usage of
recurrence relations. See the Tau Language section
[Functions and predicates](#functions-and-predicates) for more information.

* `function_def`: defines a function, supporting the usage of
recurrence relations. See the Tau Language section
[Functions and predicates](#functions-and-predicates) for more information.

* `<type> i<number> = console | ifile(<filename>)`: defines an input stream variable.
The input variable can read values from the console or from a provided file. <br>
`<type>` can be either `tau` or `sbf` (simple Boolean function) at the moment.

* `<type> o<number> = console | ofile(<filename>)`: defines an output stream variable.
The output variable can write values to the console or into a file. <br>
`<type>` can be either `tau` or `sbf` (simple Boolean function) at the moment.

## **Memory related commands**

All the results are stored in the REPL memory. You can also store well-formed Tau
formulas or Boolean functions for later reference. To do so, you can use the following
syntax:

* `tau|term`: store a tau formula or a Boolean function in the REPL memory.

If you want to consult the REPL memory contents, you can use the following commands:

* `history|hist`: show all the previously stored Tau expressions.

* `history|hist <repl_memory>`: show the Tau expression at the specified REPL memory position.

In general, to retrieve a Tau expression from the REPL memory, you can use the following
syntax for `<repl_memory>`:

* `%`: to retrieve the Tau expression stored at the latest position
* `%<number>`: to retrieve the Tau expression stored at position `<number>`
* `%-<number>`: to retrieve the Tau expression stored at the latest position minus `<number>`

## **Expression manipulation**

You can substitute expressions into other expressions or instantiate variables
in expressions. The syntax of the commands is the following:

* `subst|s <repl_memory|tau|term> [<repl_memory|tau|term>/<repl_memory|tau|term>]`: substitutes a
memory, well-formed formula or Boolean function by another one in the given
expression (this one being a memory position, well-formed formula or Boolean
function).

* `instantiate|inst|i <repl_memory|tau> [<var>/<repl_memory|term>]`: instantiates a variable
by a memory position, well-formed formula or Boolean function in the given
well-formed or Boolean function expression.

* `instantiate|inst|i <repl_memory|term> [<var>/<repl_memory|term>]`: instantiates a variable
by a memory position or Boolean function in the given expression.

## **Logical procedures**

The Tau REPL also provides a set of logical procedures that allow you to check
several aspects of the given specification/well-formed formulas/Boolean functions.
The syntax of the commands is the following:

* `valid <repl_memory|tau>`: checks if the given specification is valid.

* `sat <repl_memory|tau>`: checks if the given specification is satisfiable.

* `unsat <repl_memory|tau>`: checks if the given specification is unsatisfiable.

* `solve <repl_memory|tau>`: solves the given system of equations given by the
well-formed formula. It only computes one solution.

* `normalize|n <repl_memory|rr|ref|tau|term>`: normalizes the given expression. See
the TABA book for details.

* `qelim <repl_memory|tau>`: performs quantifier elimination on the given expression.

## **Normal forms**

Also, the Tau REPL includes several transformation procedures to standard forms.
The syntax of the commands is as follows:

* `dnf <repl_memory|tau|term>`: computes the disjunctive normal form of the given
expression.

* `cnf <repl_memory|tau|term>`: computes the conjunctive normal form of the given
expression.

* `nnf <repl_memory|tau|term>`: computes the negation normal form of the given expression.

* `mnf <repl_memory|tau|term>`: computes the minterm normal form of the given expression.

* `snf <repl_memory|tau|term>`: computes the strong normal form of the given expression.

* `onf <var> <repl_memory|tau>`: computes the order normal form of the given
expression with respect to the given variable.

## **Specification execution**

Finally, you can run a given Tau specification. The syntax for the commands is:

* `run|r <repl_memory|tau>`: runs the given Tau specification.

# **Known issues**

This is a short list of known issues that will be fixed in a subsequent release:

* Simplification:
  * Simplification of Boolean equations may take longer time in a few cases.
  * Path simplification algorithm does not take equalities between variables
  into account leading to later blow ups.
* Minor errors in Windows REPL


# **Future work**

* Enabling modular arithmatic using fixed width bitvectors in Tau specifications
* Enabling efficient data storage and manipulation in Tau specifications using Boolean functions
* Overcoming performance issues during normalization of formulas and satisfiability checking of Tau specifications
* Add support for redefinitions of functions or predicates.
* Add support for arbitrary stream names.
* Improve the performance of Boolean function normalization.
